# Seagrass
Final Project of the course: Biology and Ecology of seagrasses in the Gulf of Aqaba in IUI 

## Description
In our work we tested the effect of heat stress on the physiology of _halophila stipulacea_ - a local seagrass species to the red sea.
We tested several parameters like growth, photosynthesis rate and more on _H. stipulacea_ living in 4 different temepratures: ambient (23.5) and warming temperatures (26, 28 and 30 celsius degrees).
